# Revisiting Batch

## About
A collection of programs written in the Microsoft `batch` scripting language!

## Background (If you're interested)
A long time ago, a very technically-inclined friend of mine showed me a neat trick while we sat
next to each other in our middle school computer lab. He plugged a USB flash drive into the desktop
and right-clicked on a `.bat` file before selecting the `Run` option from the context menu. What
followed blew my curious mind. All of the sudden, the disk tray of each computer began to open and
then close, over and over. Our classmates found it hilarious, and our teacher was quite confused.

At that moment, **I was hooked**, and I decided to learn this magic that I had just witnessed. My
friend of course was caught and consequently suspended, but before he was grounded and lost his
phone privileges, he told me about `batch`, the "scripting language" he used to pull it off. With
the help of my mother, a computer science degree holder, I started to learn how to program that
same night :)

That incident led me on a now 12 year long journey that lead me to where I am, a Computer Engineering
student completing my final semester in university. Since then, I have learned Python, Java, C, and C++
(C being my favorite, if you were curious). I've worked 2 programming internships (data science and
then embedded), completed dozens of personal projects, and built quite a personality around my ever
-growing set of technical interests.

But life has been busy while pursuing education. The degree was difficult, adulthood struck, and my
life started changing faster and faster (for the better, of course), and it's not showing any signs
of slowing down. Hell, I'm about to graduate and then get married! I thought, why not go back to where
it all began? Why not re-visit the language that started it all!

## Documentation
I'm not going to spend time writing anything here because it isn't needed. The `programs/` folder
contains a folder for each program.
